# Data Dictionary Resilience Enhancement

## Problem
The Product MDM UI was failing to load product details when the data dictionary service was unavailable. This created a cascade failure where one service dependency could break core functionality.

## Root Cause
- The `useDataDictionaryFields` hook was fetching field metadata from `/api/data-dictionary`
- The data dictionary API was failing with HTTP 400 due to missing database table: `relation "averis_product.data_dictionary" does not exist`
- Product detail pages depend on this hook for field display names and validation rules
- When the hook failed, the entire product detail functionality became unavailable

## Solution
Enhanced the `useDataDictionaryFields` hook with:

### 1. In-Memory Caching (5 minutes)
- Caches successful API responses to reduce API load
- Provides faster subsequent page loads
- Cache duration: 5 minutes (configurable)

### 2. Fallback Data Dictionary
- Essential field definitions prevent UI failure
- Includes core fields: SKU, Name, Description, Status, Type, Base Price, Cost Price
- Provides basic field metadata when API unavailable

### 3. Graceful Degradation
- UI continues working even when data dictionary service fails
- Shows warning banner when using fallback data
- Field labels may appear generic but functionality remains intact
- Automatic fallback to essential field definitions

### 4. Enhanced Field Resolution
- `getFieldMetadata()` function provides graceful fallback for unknown fields
- Generates reasonable display names from camelCase field names
- Maintains UI consistency even with missing field definitions

## Implementation Details

### Caching Logic
```javascript
// Check cache first (5-minute duration)
if (dataDictionaryCache && cacheTimestamp && (now - cacheTimestamp < CACHE_DURATION)) {
  // Use cached data
}

// Fetch fresh data and update cache
const data = await fetch('/api/data-dictionary')
dataDictionaryCache = data.data_dictionary
cacheTimestamp = now
```

### Fallback Data Structure
```javascript
const FALLBACK_DATA_DICTIONARY = [
  {
    columnName: 'sku',
    displayName: 'SKU Code',
    dataType: 'varchar',
    requiredForActive: true,
    maintenanceRole: 'product_marketing',
    // ... other essential field definitions
  }
]
```

### UI Warning System
- Yellow warning banner appears when using fallback data
- Informs users that some field labels may appear generic
- Assures users that product functionality remains available

## Benefits

1. **Resilience**: Product detail functionality works even when data dictionary service is down
2. **Performance**: 5-minute caching reduces API load and improves response times
3. **User Experience**: Clear warning messages and graceful degradation
4. **Maintainability**: Centralized fallback definitions in one location
5. **Developer Experience**: Console logging shows cache hits/misses and fallback usage

## Testing

1. **Normal Operation**: Data dictionary loads from API and caches for 5 minutes
2. **API Failure**: Automatic fallback to essential field definitions
3. **Cache Testing**: Subsequent requests use cached data when available
4. **UI Resilience**: Product pages load and function even with fallback data

## Console Messages
- `📊 Using cached data dictionary` - Cache hit
- `🔄 Fetching fresh data dictionary from API` - Fresh API call
- `⚠️ Data dictionary API failed, using fallback` - Fallback mode
- `📝 Using fallback data dictionary with essential fields` - Fallback confirmation

## Future Enhancements

1. **Persistent Caching**: Store in localStorage for browser session persistence
2. **Background Refresh**: Attempt API refresh in background while using cached/fallback data
3. **Field Definition Expansion**: Add more fields to fallback dictionary as needed
4. **Service Health Monitoring**: Integrate with system monitoring for data dictionary health
5. **Admin Tools**: Provide cache management tools in settings page

## Impact
This enhancement eliminates cascade failures and ensures that core product management functionality remains available even when auxiliary services (like data dictionary) are experiencing issues.
