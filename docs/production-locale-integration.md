# Production Locale Integration Architecture

## Automated Content Localization Pipeline

### 1. Product Catalog Assignment Trigger

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Product Added to Catalog] --> B{Region has Locales?}
    B -->|Yes| C[Queue Translation Jobs]
    B -->|No| D[Skip Localization]
    C --> E[Call Translation API]
    C --> F[Call Currency API] 
    E --> G[Create product_locale_content]
    F --> H[Create product_locale_financials]
    G --> I[Queue for Review if Required]
    H --> I
```

### 2. Required External Services

#### Translation Services
- **Primary**: DeepL API (highest quality for business content)
- **Fallback**: Google Translate API (broader language support)
- **Custom**: Industry-specific terminology APIs
- **Human Review**: Integration with translation management platforms

#### Currency Services
- **Primary**: European Central Bank (ECB) for EUR rates
- **Secondary**: Federal Reserve for USD base rates
- **Commercial**: ExchangeRate-API for real-time updates
- **Backup**: Local rate caching with manual overrides
